os:
  details: >
    I prefer Unix based systems for general development.
    I would however, be happy with Windows for .Net or similar Microsoft specific development.
  distros:
    - name: NixOS
      details: >
        I've recently started using NixOS, it has the complexity of Arch so it takes a while to setup.
        However, once setup it is amazing, being able to have multiple versions of the same OS without bloat is great.
        I've had to rollback a few times too, its completely painless.
    - name: Ubuntu (Gnome)
      details: >
        Ubuntu is my "old faithful" os. When I want a bit more stability I use ubuntu.
        Although I still tend to stick with nightly releases. I really like Gnome and use it on NixOS and ubuntu.
        Unfortunately there's too much bloat in Gnome these days, it may cause me to switch.
    - name: Centos
      details: >
        At PSE we target RHEL, thus Centos is a prime candidate when testing.
        All of the infrastructure is setup for Centos,
        thus setting up a development on any OS other then Windows or Centos becomes a bit of a mission.

version_control:
  name: Git
  details: >
    I prefer a git-flow based, rebase --no-ff merge strategy. This keeps a linear history.
    I've also written plenty of internal tooling/scripts dealing with Git. primarily with GitPython.

ides:
 - name: Intellij IDEA
   details: >
    I use Intellij everyday for most development.
    For Java specifically I struggle to see a reason to use anything else.
    I do feel Intellij IDEA is too bloated most of the time however,
    I hope Language Server + Text Editors become a more viable option in the future.
 - name: Webstorm
   details: >
       Go to for Web development, although I do not feel an IDE is anywhere near as useful for web dev as it is for Java dev,
       I occasionally use a text editor instead.
 - name: Atom
   details: >
       Current goto text editor, although I may switch to Visual Studio Code. It feels bloated to me.
 - name: Gedit
   details: >
       I use Gedit for Git related work. Atom starts too slow and I have
       not yet spent enough time with Vim to use that.


profilers:
 - name: Yourkit
   details: >
    I would recommend Yourkit to anyone, Yourkit makes optimizing code a breeze.
 - name: VisualVM
   details: >
    I stopped using VisualVM after we purchased Yourkit. Yourkit really is far superior here.
