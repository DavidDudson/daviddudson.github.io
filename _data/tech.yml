  - name: Category theory
    details: >
      I recently learnt basic category theory.
      This helped me understand programming from a methematical perspective.

      Natural Transformations. I still want to do far more research into
      this field.
  - name: Functional Programming
    details: >
      I believe that Functional Programming is a far too common of a phrase these days, when a lot of people mean "programming with functions".
      Functional programming is not just about having functions representable at the type level.
      I use purely immutable data structures and try to be as pure as possible,
      handling effects at the type level, where it does not affect Readability, Maintainability or Performance.
      I can proudly say that I have not deliberately used the keyword "null" in my code, for well over a year.
