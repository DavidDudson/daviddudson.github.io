ides:
 - name: Intellij IDEA
   details: >
    I use Intellij everyday for most development.
    For Java specifically I struggle to see a reason to use anything else.
 - name: Webstorm
   details: >
       Go to for Web development, although I do not feel an IDE is anywhere near as useful for web dev as it is for Java dev,
       I occasionally use a text editor instead.
 - name: Atom
   details: >
       My usual text editor, I use it quite a bit for web development aswell.
 - name: Gedit
   details: >
       I use Gedit for Git related work. Atom starts too slow and I have
       not yet spent enough time with Vim to use that.

profilers:
 - name: Yourkit
   details: >
    I would recommend Yourkit to anyone, Yourkit makes optimizing code a breeze.
 - name: VisualVM
   details: >
    I stopped using VisualVM after we purchased Yourkit. Yourkit really is far superior here.
