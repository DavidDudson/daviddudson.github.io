os:
  details: >
    I prefer Unix based systems for general development, usually one of NixOS, Ubuntu, Fedora or OSX.

version_control:
  details: >
    I exclusively use git for version control. I am very competent
    with git and have written a number of internal scripts for it.

libraries:
  - name: Scala
    details: >
      I have been writing Scala code since 2012, working with it in industry for the past 2 years.
      I consider myself an advanced Scala user and have given talks on Scala before.
      Most of my open source work has been creating and/or contributing to Scala libraries.
      I've a large number of Scala libraries, but most commonly Cats, Monix, Circe and Scalameta.
  - name: Java
    details: >
      Java was the first language I learnt. Self taught while I was at high school I have been writing Java code since 2011.
      A large portion of the codebase I work in is Java and I consider myself an advanced Java user.
  - name: Python
    details: >
      I use Python mostly for scripting and web scraping. I've attended multiple
      Kiwi Pycons and always enjoyed the friendliness of the Python community.
  - name: Javascript
    details: >
      I've written a lot of javascript, mostly during my time at university,
      I have experience ES5, ES6, Typescript and Coffeescript.
      I've also written code in AngularJS, Angular and React,
      using tools such as NPM, Bower, Gulp and Webkit.
  - name: Antlr 4
    details: >
      A large portion of my work recently has been writing ANTLR4 Grammars,
      a Scala AST to go with them and ensuring performance has been optimal.
      Due to this, I've subclassed and replaced large portions of the ANTLR
      code as it was non-optimal, generating far too much garbage for our uses.
  - name: Ansible
    details: >
      I have written multiple sets of Ansible scripts, for provisioning build machines and setting up dev environments.
  - name: Gradle
    details: >
      Due to being in charge of the Maven => Gradle porting of our build system at work,
      I have become a competent Gradle/Groovy developer.
  - name: Category theory
    details: >
      Last year I taught myself basic category theory. I wanted to get a ground up understanding of
      category theory so that when working with the Cats library, I could understand the reasoning and terminology.
      In particular, I wanted to develop an understanding the Free Monads and Natural Transformations.
      I still want to do far more research into this field and personally believe it should
      be part of every Computer Science curriculum globally.
  - name: Functional Programming
    details: >
      I believe that Functional Programming is a far too common of a phrase these days, when a lot of people mean "programming with functions".
      Functional programming is not just about having functions representable at the type level.
      I use purely immutable data structures and try to be as pure as possible,
      handling effects at the type level, where it does not affect Readability, Maintainability or Performance.
      I can proudly say that I have not deliberately used the keyword "null" in my code, for well over a year.

ides:
 - name: IntelliJ IDEA
   details: >
        I use IntelliJ every day for most development.
        For Java specifically, I struggle to see a reason to use anything else.
 - name: Webstorm
   details: >
       Go to for Web development, although I do not feel an IDE is anywhere
       near as useful for web dev as it is for Java dev,
       I occasionally use a text editor instead.
 - name: Atom
   details: >
       My usual text editor, I use it quite a bit for web development as well.
 - name: Gedit
   details: >
       I use Gedit for Git related work. Atom starts too slow and I have
       not yet spent enough time with Vim to use that.

profilers:
 - name: Yourkit
   details: >
    I would recommend Yourkit to anyone, Yourkit makes optimizing code a breeze.
 - name: VisualVM
   details: >
    I stopped using VisualVM after we purchased Yourkit. Yourkit really is far superior here.
