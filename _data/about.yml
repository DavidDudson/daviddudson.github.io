  I am a cross paradigm developer who primarily deals with meta-programming in Scala.
  My current job is developing a Swing based Desktop application for Process Modelling in Java/Scala.
  I plan to work on tooling and/or language design in the future.
  In the mean time, I want to get experience working in various fields
  too see what language needs different industries have.
