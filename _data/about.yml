  I am a cross paradigm developer looking to further my skillset.
  I am willing to work in an language and/or paradigm, although I prefer Scala and a semi-functional style.
  I believe writing software is a craft. Craftsman work tirelessly to hone their skills,
  using tools to make their craft easier or accelerate learning.
  I also believe that a good craftsman can do well, no matter what tool is thrown at him.
