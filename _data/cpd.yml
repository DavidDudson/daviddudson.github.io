open_source:
  - name: scalagen
    involvement: Author
    link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalgen
    details: >
      scalagen is a new library + build tool plugin for enabling typesafe code generation.
      The plan is to replace most functionality that is available via Macro Annotations in scala.
      Macro annotations have a huge problem in that they are compiler plugins, thus not very portable.
  - name: scalameta
    involvement: Maintainer
    link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalgen
    details: >
      scalameta is effectively a library surrounding metaprogramming exclusively with the scala language.
      It enables everything from code generation, to editing, to retrieving fully qualified names etc.
      Recently there has been a push to create a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation in scalameta.
      The idea behind scalameta is to be a central library for all scala related tooling to be based off.
