    I try to attend as many conferences as I can.
    It's always interesting to see what the community is up to.
  events:
    - name: Kiwi Pycon
      category: Python

      details: >
        It is regarded as one of the most social conferences and has one of the best communities.
        I have attended Kiwi Pycon in Dunedin and Christchurch.
        I gave a lightning talk on GitPython scripting in Dunedin.

      details: >
        Kiwicon X was an amazing conference to go to.
        It is a huge conference about everything from
        physical security, hacking, damage reduction etc.

      details: >
        I went to NZJS con hoping someone would talk about Web ASM.
        Although I ended up being drawn in by GraphQL and hybrid
        single page/server rendered apps.

open_source:
  - name: scalagen
    involvement: Author
    link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalagen
    details: >
      scalagen is a new library + build tool plugin for enabling typesafe code generation.
      The plan is to replace most functionality that is available via Macro Annotations in scala.
      Macro annotations have a huge problem in that they are compiler plugins, thus not very portable.
      There's also issues with typed/untyped trees and compiler desugarings.
  - name: scalameta
    involvement: Maintainer
    link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta
    details: >
      scalameta is a library allowing parsing and manipulation of scala language trees.
      The model has been designed with users in mind and is fairly simple to understand.
      This enables everything from tooling to macros in a way that most developers can use.
      this pushes tooling away from compiler internals that are largely unnecessary.
      scalameta also supports multiple "dialects", each dialect is a different version of scala.
      Thus we can target any scala version, new or old.
  - name: scalameta paradise
    involvement: Maintainer
    link: https://github.com/scalameta/paradise
    details: >
      Paradise was going to be the replacement for scalamacros/paradise,
      which is the dated, experimental macro library for scala. It
      allows users to manipulate scalameta trees, rather then compiler trees.
      There were numerous issues, it has now been deprecated in favour of scalagen.
      And targeted code generators should feel identical to annotation macros,
      without the burden of maintaining a compiler plugin.
  - name: multibot
    involvement: Contributor
    link: https://github.com/DavidDudson/multibot
    details: >
      Multibot is an IRC based chat bot that acts like a repl for people in IRC and Gitter.
      I replaced the IRC part of multibot with a Faye client for gitter. This allows things such as
      Multiline output, loading text, reformatting messages etc.
      This bot was used in the scalameta gitter channel and the plan is to push the work upstream at some point.
  - name: Elysium
    involvement: Author
    link: https://github.com/DavidDudson/Elysium
    example:
    details: >
      Elysium is a collection of annotation macros for scalameta/paradise.
      It also uses annotation macros to simplify creation of annotation macros.
      The work here was put on hold when it became clear that scalameta/paradise
      was going to become deprecated. Once scalagen is up and running
      it will be fully ported to that library. Read the scaladoc
      <a href="https://github.com/DavidDudson/Elysium/blob/master/gen/src/main/scala/nz/daved/elysium/gen/MacroAnnotation.scala">
      here</a> for an example of how simple it can be to write a macro with Elysium.

  - group: IT Professionals New Zealand (ITPNZ)
    events:
      - name: The Project Rots From The Head.
        details: >
          It was the inaugural meeting for the new Palmerston North based branch of ITPNZ.
          The talk, given by Colin D. Ellis was bout how project managers and stakeholders
          can influence the outcome of a project.

          I would have become a member of ITPNZ if I had not planned to move to Australia.
          I plan to join IT Professionals Australia (ITPA) once I arrive in Australia.
  - group: Palmerston North Software Developement Meetup Group.
    events:
      - name: Lunch & Pub.
        details: >
          Every so often the group have lunch together.
          This is a great way to network and learn about the interesting work others in the community are doing.
      - name: Videos
        details: >
          Around once a month the group have a video night.
          Usually the video is a conference talk overseas about some fairly generic
          topic such as UX, ethics, project management etc.
      - name: Talks
        details: >
          Occasionally a member of the group will give a presentation.
          I have been to the ones of interest. Unfortunately I could not attend Jonathan Giles talk. (Oracle Employee).
          I have also given a talk on Scala at these events.
      - name: Workshops
        details: >
          I gave a Scala workshop following my talk, teaching the basics of scala development.
          Around 25 attended and it seemed to go pretty well.
