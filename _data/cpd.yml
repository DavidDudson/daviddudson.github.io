  info: >
    My occupation is also my hobby,
    in my free time I contribute to the open source community.
    I often write PR’s for libraries, assist with support on Gitter
    and help with issue management.
  projects:
    - name: scalagen
      involvement: Author
      link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalagen
      details: >
        I authored this library primarily because the existing
        scalameta/paradise library was deprecated,
        and scalamacros/paradise is not ide or user friendly.
        I manage everything from issues to design and implementation.
    - name: Elysium
      involvement: Author
      link: https://github.com/DavidDudson/Elysium
      details: >
        Elysium was an exploration of what could be accomplished with Macro Annotations,
        I also wrote a macro to develop macros. All Elysium macros are strongly typed and became
        the foundation of scalagen’s API.
    - name: scalameta
      involvement: Maintainer

      details: >
        A huge center point for Scala’s tooling which exists
        primarily as an AST manipulation library.
        I am the co-author of the scalameta-contrib module,
        built to simplify interactions with scalameta.
    - name: scalameta paradise
      involvement: Maintainer
      link: https://github.com/scalameta/paradise
      details: >
        Macro library for Scala. Now deprecated in favor of
        scalameta/scalagen (annotation macros) and scalacenter/macros
        (def macros). I have written a large portion of the annotation
        processing logic used to ensure feature parity with
        scalamacros/paradise.

  info:
    I attend as many talks and events as possible, via Massey University,
    IT Professionals of New Zealand (ITPNZ) or
    the Palmerston North Software Development Meetup Group.
    Once I have arrived in Cairns I will be joining IT Professionals Australia.
    I have also given a talk and workshop for Scala to around 30 people at the meetup group.
