  info: >
    Attending as many conferences as possible I enjoy networking and learning how the industry is evolving.
    I have been to multiple conferences including Kiwi Pycon, Kiwicon X and NZJSCon.
    One of my highlights was presenting a lightning talk on GitPython at Kiwi Pycon, Dunedin.
    I will be attending Linux Conference Australia in Sydney at the end of January 2018.

    I have a passion for writing code, especially when it is consumed by a large number of users.
    I'm always looking for more ways to help out the open source community.

    I attend as many talks and events as possible, via Massey University,
    IT Professionals of New Zealand (ITPNZ) or
    the Palmerston North Software Development Meetup Group.
    Once I have arrived in Cairns I will be joining IT Professionals Australia.
    I have also given a talk and workshop for Scala to around 30 people at the meetup group.
