    In the past I have worked extensively in the open source section of the scala ecosystem.
    Although in the last 2 years I have done no open source work.
  projects:
    - name: scalagen
      involvement: Author
      link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalagen
      details: >
        I authored this library primarily because the existing
        scalameta/paradise library was deprecated,
        and scalamacros/paradise is not ide or user friendly.
        I managed everything from issues to design and implementation.
        No longer maintained as I left the Scala ecosystem.
    - name: Elysium
      involvement: Author

      details: >
        Elysium was an exploration of what could be accomplished with Macro Annotations,
        I also wrote a macro to develop macros. All Elysium macros are strongly typed and became
        the foundation of scalagen’s API. No longer maintained as I left the Scala ecosystem.

      details: >
        A huge center point for Scala’s tooling which exists
        primarily as an AST manipulation library.
        I am the co-author of the scalameta-contrib module,
        built to simplify interactions with scalameta.
    - name: scalameta paradise
      involvement: Maintainer

      details: >
        Macro library for Scala. Now deprecated in favor of
        scalameta/scalagen (annotation macros) and scalacenter/macros
        (def macros). I have written a large portion of the annotation
        processing logic used to ensure feature parity with
        scalamacros/paradise.

    I enjoy attend conferences and programming events,
    I would like to grow the Software Development community in Cairns and potentially start a meetup group.
