    I try to attend as many conferences as I can.
    I enjoy networking and learning how the industry is evolving.
    I have been to multiple conferences including Kiwi Pycon, Kiwicon X and NZJSCon.
    I gave a lightning talk on GitPython at Kiwi Pycon, Dunedin.
    I will be attending Linux Conf Australia in January 2018.

    I attend as many talks and events as possible, via Massey University,
    IT Professionals of New Zealand (ITPNZ) or
    the Palmerston North Software Development Meetup Group.
