  info: >
    My occupation is also my hobby. I'm always looking for more ways to help out the open source community.
    I will often write PR’s for libraries, help to manage and report issues or assist with support
    on Gitter.

        Scalagen is a work in progress code generation library for Scala.
        Scalagen can support any variant and version of Scala. I authored this
        library primarily because the existing scalameta/paradise library was
        deprecated and scalamacros/paradise is not ide or user friendly. I manage everything from issues to design and implementation.
    - name: Elysium
      involvement: Author
      link: https://github.com/DavidDudson/Elysium
      details: >
        Elysium was an exploration of what could be accomplished with Macro Annotations,
        I also wrote a macro to develop macros. All Elysium macros are strongly typed and became
        the foundation of scalagen’s API.
    - name: scalameta
      involvement: Maintainer
      link: https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta
      details: >
        A huge center point for Scala’s tooling. Exists primarily as an AST for the scala language.
        I am the co-author of the scalameta-contrib module, built to simplify interactions with scalameta.
    - name: scalameta paradise
      involvement: Maintainer
      link: https://github.com/scalameta/paradise
      details: >
        Macro library for Scala. Now deprecated in favor of scalameta/scalagen (Annotation Macros) and
        scalacenter/macros (Def Macros). I wrote a large portion of the annotation processing logic,
        to ensure feature parity with scalamacros/paradise.

  info:
    I attend as many talks and events as possible, via Massey University,
    IT Professionals of New Zealand (ITPNZ) or
    the Palmerston North Software Development Meetup Group.
    Once I have arrived in Cairns I will be joining IT Professionals Australia.
    I have also given a talk and workshop for Scala to around 30 people at the meetup group.
