    Based in Palmerston North, New Zealand, Contracting out to Process Systems Enterprise,
    which is based in London.
  product: >
    I am working on the gPROMS family of integrated modelling environments (IME's),
    designed for various engineers who design incredibly complex systems.
    The kernel is written in C++ and Fortran, with the UI written in Java.
    gPROMS is primarily a procedural/declarative language that is used to run simulations/optimizations etc.
    Thus the IME's act much like an IDE would for a Software Developer.
  projects:
    - name: New Language Engine (NLE)
      details: >
        The purpose of this project was primarily to remove
        a large chunk of the remaining CORBA code in our codebase.
        Using Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, we managed to build a fast,
        efficient module.
    - name: Moving from Maven to Gradle
      details: >
        Our build system is rather complex, we have multiple "code generation" steps,
        multiple jvm languages being used, extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption)
        and multiple repositories. The build was designed to be modular via Gradle plugins.
    - name: Flowsheet Routing
      details: >
        Our users were generating models in other applications, with 2000+ models and connections between them.
        The routing took place on Swings GUI Thread (EDT) and thus blocked the user from working while it happened.
        For user generated projects this could happen on project load and trigger up to 8 hour GUI freezes.
        Of course this is not acceptable, I moved all routing off the EDT. The largest problem was undo.
        We had asynchronous edits that had to be managed within Swings very synchronous and sequential undo system.
