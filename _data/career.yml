    I have managed projects and junior developers, I attended World Travel Mart London 2019 to
    assist with technical discussions relating to sales. As a fullstack developer I have been in charge

    - name: Didgigo API and Import Server
      details: >
        The Didgigo API was produced so we could move away from using a single dedicated server, into a cloud based envorinment.
        The API enabled external customers to interface directly with Didgigo, aswell as all cloud based systems using
        the API for general activities. We also interfaced with a number of pieces of Tour Operator software,
        such as Tourplan and Softrip to automate the import of content (Hotel/Tour content) and production of documentation (Itineraries).

      details: >
        The Productivity Suite is and Angular 9 web application to introspect how imports are running.
        With the ability to be as transparent as possible with regards to how data is transformed from
        third party systems into the Didgigo data model and see which itineraries have been imported.
        the entire system has a consistent format so using the system is the same for all Third Party API's.

previous:
  company: Electric Memory IT (EMIT)
  contracted_to: Process Systems Enterprise (PSE)
  time: June 2015 - March 2017
  product: >
   I was part of many projects at PSE/EMIT.
   They challenged me and allowed me to grow as a developer under the guidance of a very good team.
  projects:
    - name: New Language Engine (NLE)
      details: >
       Using Scala for AST and validation logic,
       and Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, I collaborate in a
       team of three to build a fast, immutable, threadsafe and
       storage efficient language module. I have written most of the
       Antlr grammars, the parsing logic and a large portion of the
       language model. Whilst the rest of the team worked on integration
       with existing code.
      key_skills:
        - Scala
        - Antlr4
        - Anltr2
        - Java
        - C++
    - name: Maven to Gradle migration
      details: >
        I led the Gradle migration project. Our build system is rather complex,
         we have multiple code generation steps, multiple JVM languages
         being used, extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption) and
         multiple repositories. The build was designed to be modular via
         Gradle plugins. I had to manage other developers such as the CI and
         Kernel teams. The build had to run fast and support both Windows and
         Linux.
      key_skills:
        - Gradle
        - Groovy
        - Java
    - name: Flowsheet Routing
      details: >
        Flowsheet routing is the act of ensuring the connection between nodes
        on a flowsheet are orthogonal. For user-generated projects this
        could happen on project load and could trigger up to 8 hour GUI freezes. I moved the route calculations off the event dispatch thread (Swingâ€™s GUI thread), ensuring asynchronous execution. I also altered all routing actions so they would be undoable, parallelizable and cancellable.
      key_skills:
       - Swing
       - Java
       - Threading
