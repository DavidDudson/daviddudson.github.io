    Based in Palmerston North, New Zealand, Contracting out to Process Systems Enterprise,
    which is based in London.
  product: >
    I am working on the gPROMS family of integrated modelling environments (IME's),
    designed for various engineers who design incredibly complex systems.
    The kernel is written in C++ and Fortran, with the UI written in Java.
    gPROMS is primarily a procedural/declarative language that is used to run simulations/optimizations etc.
    Thus the IME's act much like an IDE would for a Software Developer.
    With large global clients such as Eli Lilly Pharmaceuticals and Shell Petroleum
    I take the quality of code I produce very seriously.
  projects:
    - name: New Language Engine (NLE)
      details: >
        The purpose of this project was primarily to remove
        a large chunk of the remaining CORBA code in our codebase.
        Using Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, we managed to build a fast,
        efficient language module.
    - name: Moving from Maven to Gradle
      details: >
        Our build system is rather complex, we have multiple "code generation" steps,
        multiple JVM languages being used, extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption)
        and multiple repositories. The build was designed to be modular via Gradle plugins.
    - name: Flowsheet Routing
      details: >
        Our users were generating models in other applications, with 2000+ models and connections between them.
        The routing took place on Swings GUI Thread (EDT) and thus blocked the user from working while it happened.
        For user-generated projects this could happen on project load and trigger up to 8 hour GUI freezes.
        Of course, this is not acceptable, thus I moved all routing off the EDT. The largest problem was undo.
        We had asynchronous edits that had to be managed within Swings very synchronous and sequential undo system.
