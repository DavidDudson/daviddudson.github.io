   I have been a part of many projects at PSE/EMIT.
   They have challenged me and allowed me to grow as a developer.
  projects:
    - name: New Language Engine (NLE)
      details: >
       Using Scala for AST and validation logic,
       and Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, I collaborate in a
       team of three to build a fast, immutable, threadsafe and
       storage efficient language module. I have written most of the
       Antlr grammars, the parsing logic and a large portion of the
       language model. Whilst the rest of the team worked on integration
       with existing code.
      key_skills:
        - Scala
        - Antlr4
        - Anltr2
        - Java
        - C++
    - name: Maven to Gradle migration
      details: >
        I led the Gradle migration project. Our build system is rather complex,
         we have multiple code generation steps, multiple JVM languages
         being used, extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption) and
         multiple repositories. The build was designed to be modular via
         Gradle plugins. I had to manage other developers such as the CI and
         Kernel teams. The build had to run fast and support both Windows and
         Linux.
      key_skills:
        - Gradle
        - Groovy
        - Java
    - name: Flowsheet Routing
      details: >
        Flowsheet routing is the act of ensuring the connection between nodes
        on a flowsheet are orthogonal. For user-generated projects this
        could happen on project load and could trigger up to 8 hour GUI freezes. I moved the route calculations off the event dispatch thread (Swingâ€™s GUI thread), ensuring asynchronous execution. I also altered all routing actions so they would be undoable, parallelizable and cancellable.
      key_skills:
       - Swing
       - Java
       - Threading
