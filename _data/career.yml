  details: >
    Based in Palmerston North, New Zealand, Contracting out to Process Systems Enterprise,
    which is based in London.
  product: >
   I have been a part of many projects at PSE/EMIT.
   They have challenged me and allowed me to grow as a developer.
  projects:
    - name: New Language Engine (NLE)
      details: >
        Using Antlr4 as our parser and lexer, with Scala as the language of choice,
        I collaborate in a team of three to build a fast, immutable, threadsafe and
        storage efficient language module. I wrote most of the Antlr grammars,
        the parsing logic and a large portion of the language model.
        The rest of the team worked on integration with existing code.
      key_skills:
        - Antlr4
        - Anltr2
        - Scala
        - Java
        - C++
    - name: Maven to Gradle migration
      details: >
        I led the Gradle migration project. Our build system is rather complex,
        we have multiple code generation steps, multiple JVM languages being used,
        extra post-compile tasks (obfuscation and encryption) and multiple repositories.
        The build was designed to be modular via Gradle plugins. I had to manage many other people,
        other developers, our CI team, our Kernel team. The build had to run fast and support both
        windows and Linux.
      key_skills:
        - Groovy
        - Gradle
        - Java
    - name: Flowsheet Routing
      details: >
        Flowsheet routing is the act of ensuring the connection between nodes on a flowsheet are orthogonal.
        For user-generated projects this could happen on project load and could trigger up to 8 hour
        GUI freezes. I moved all routing calculation off the event dispatch thread (Swingâ€™s GUI thread),
        made them async, and ensured all routing actions would be undoable, parallelizable and cancellable.
      key_skills:
       - Swing
       - Java
       - Threading
